# Lark grammar syntax support for VSCode


## Forked Description

This fork adds highlighting for some of the syntax from the current version of Lark's grammar, which is missing from the original extension. (It's also a fun way to help me learn about writing a simple VS Code extension)

## Installation

Make sure node.js is installed, then install vsce::

npm install -g @vscode/vsce

Then make the package::

    vsce package

Then install from VSCode's extensions menu -> install from visx file
